	<h1>Nathan</h1>
	<div id="paragraphs">
		<p style="color: red; font-family: fantasy;" >I was born in Los Angeles, California on March 15, 2004. I lived in L.A. until the age of 2 and then I moved to Atlanta, GA. My family first moved to downtown Atlanta, but we soon moved to the suburbs of Marietta to live next to my grandparents. After this moment, my family settled down in Marietta.</p>
		
		<p style="color: darkblue; font-family: fantasy;">I was raised in Marietta with my mom, dad, and sister. I attended Sawyer Road Elementary, Marietta Center for Advanced Academics (MCAA), Marietta Sixth Grade Academy, and Marietta Middle School. I was lucky enough to make life-long friends that would be with me since elementary school. In August 2018, I became a freshman at Marietta High School, and I enjoyed my first year of high school. Jumping to the present, I am currently enrolled in the SMASH academy at Morehouse College learning about STEM. This program takes place during the summers after my 9th, 10th, and 11th grade years.</p>

 <h1 style="color: blue;">Noah</h1>
<p style="color: blue; font "> <font face="verdana">I was born in Newark, New Jersey in the general hosptial. It wasn't anything special. I was born normally, in a normal hospital. My parents decided to move me here to Georgia to move away from the more rougher areas of Jersey they were living in. My sister was born in Georgia only after a tear she was born and like a lot of siblings, she was my best friend. I went to Eastside Elementary, Chapel Hill Middle School, and Chapel Hill High. I never had to move to new areas and change schools. In elementary school I was a teacher's son and everybody knew me. The teachers loved me and I had lots of friends, but then I went to Chapel Hill when all my friends went to Turner.</p><br>
<p style="color: blue;">In middle school I made all my real friends, people I still talk to tooday and really trust. Its also where I decided to commit to band. I play Bassoon, Oboe, and Percussion. Im in the marching band and it means so much to me.</p><br>

		<h1 style="color:black">DeCarlos</h1>
		<p>"They call me Megatron, shorty's a mega con!"</p>
		<p style="border: 2px solid black">DeCarlos is a warrior! He will tirelessly fight for what he believes in. DeCarlos has been painted as the bad guy so he chose to embrace that role of being a decepticon, single handily annihilating his foes. Contrarily, DeCarlos is undeniably friendly and he's easy to chat with. His charisma and energy is unmatched. Additionally, DeCarlos values friendship and loyalty. One quote that resonates with him most is, "Go against Nicki it's gon cost ya!" So if I were you, I wouldn't betray him in any way(and he is a huge fan of Nicki Minaj.) On another note, DeCarlos practices self love and demonstrates what a bold leader should look like. DeCarlos loves to laugh especially when a silly knock off appears out of the blue. DeCarlos wants you to remember that "It aint about the race either it's a marathon." Insinuating that his legacy could never be undone</p>

		<p style="color: white">.I am Kali J.S. Oden I live in Atlanta, Georgia. I was born on November 6, 2003 to my parents Damon Oden and Brandy Graham in Northside Hospital. I've lived in Decataur and Camp Creek. I've been paintballing and let me just say if you don't like pain don't do it. I am also apart of a few clubs like F.B.L.A,Latin club,J.R.O.T.C, and now N.S.H.S.S. Honors. I have two brothers one is 24 and one is 4.<br>                                        

<br>I have four bestfriends because I am a special breed and I am very "active". They are my devils and angels in their own sense in that they give me pro's and con's. I have fallen asleep in every class for the first few days, but I've greatly improved myself since then.I am enjoying S.M.A.S.H very much because it challenges me to do better but I'm happy that the R.A.'s don't mind helping out.<br>
