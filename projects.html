<h1 style="text-align: center; box-shadow: 0px 5px #173F5F">Can Gonorrhea be treated?</h1>
<p id="fourth">Yes, Gonorrhea can be treated using the right treatment. This includes: dual therapy, or using two drugs, to treat gonorrhea – a single dose of 250mg of intramuscular ceftriaxone AND 1g of oral azithromycin. It is important to take all of the medication prescribed to cure gonorrhea. However, Gonorrhea is becoming harder to treat do to the resistance the disease is taking on to the treatment.</p>
